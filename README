--------------------------------

Files:

./lib.js
    - contains the classes and core functionality required to complete the challenge
    - file is written using only javascript language features supported by the v8 engine (ECMA-262 5th Ed.)
    - file exports 2 new classes and re-exports 1:
        + Product
        + ProductHandler
        + Math - adds add(x, y) method
    - the code is written in a quasi-functional style

./test.js
    - contains unit tests relevant to ./lib.js
    - unit test framework used is 'nodeunit'
        + can be installed with: npm install nodeunit -g
        + can be run with: nodeunit ./test.js
    - there are no unit tests defined for ./run.js

./run.js
    - contains "plumbing" used to facilitate the stdin -> stdout pipeline
    - responsible for running the primary usecase:
        + namely, that the solution processes stdin and writes to stdout
    - makes use of 1 external npm package:
        + split - splits a text stream into a line stream
            * can be installed with: npm install split -g

./input
    - contains the test input outlined in the challenge document

./expect
    - contains the expected test output outlined in the challenge document

./acceptance.sh
    - a small bash script that will run the solution in its entirety, and diff'ing the output against the expected output.

Notes:
    - the bulk of this challenge took approximately 4-6 hours to complete.
        + it included a power sub-station failure and a separate internet outage, for added fun.
    - I feel that this challenge was well-described and enjoyable.
